# BYU MAGICC Archive

This is a read-only organization for repositories archived by the BYU MAGICC lab, primarily repositories from the old GitLab server. All repositories from that server are organized as `{project name or username}__{subdirectory, if there is one}__{repository name}`. There are also teams made in this organization that group all repos by project or username.

This is intended as a read-only archive, if you need to edit any of this code, clone the repository and push a copy to the byu-magicc organization instead of pushing to this organization.
