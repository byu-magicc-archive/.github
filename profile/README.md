# BYU MAGICC Archive

This is a read-only organization for repositories archived by the BYU MAGICC lab, primarily repositories from the old GitLab server. All repositories from that server are organized as `{project name or username}__{subdirectory, if there is one}__{repository name}`. There are also teams made in this organization that group all repos by project or username.

This is intended as a read-only archive, if you need to edit any of this code, clone the repository and push a copy to the byu-magicc organization instead of pushing to this organization.

There are some repositories from the archive that exceeded GitHub's filesize limit and are not found on this group. This included the following:

```
Jerel/gazebo_sim.git
brendon/cooperative_navigation_paper.git
brendon/dissertation.git
control_book/control_book.git
gellings/im2att_tf.git
grastagg33/radar_detection_estimation.git
jaringson/dragonfly_ws.git
lab/airsim_environments.git
mark_peterson/darknet_ros.git
mark_peterson/dnn_pose_estimator.git
mass/algorithms.git
multi_mission/MissionSimulation.git
multi_mission/gesture-control.git
multi_mission/gpr_road.git
plusk01/gazebo_sim.git
robust_tracking/target_following_with_visual_mtt.git
skyler237/handoff.git
superjax/501R.git
thanedowning/camera_imu_transform_calibration.git
thanedowning/project_ws.git
```

To find these repositories, please access the bare repository archive on the J Drive. To create a typical repository from a bare repository, you just need to clone the repo using the filepath instead of a URL. `git clone {path_to_bare_repo.git}` You can even use an ssh path if you'd like `git clone {netID}@scp.et.byu.edu:/fsf/{netID}/groups/magicc-data/gitlab_archive/{group name}/{repo_name}.git`
